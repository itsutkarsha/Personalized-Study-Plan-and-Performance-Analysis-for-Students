# Personalized-Study-Plan-and-Performance-Analysis-for-Students

In the era of digital transformation, educational institutions are increasingly adopting intelligent systems to streamline academic monitoring and enhance student outcomes. This research presents the design and development of a School Portal - Student Performance Analysis System, aimed at providing a centralized platform for analyzing and visualizing students' academic performance. The system integrates key functionalities such as student record management, performance tracking across multiple assessments, and real-time analytics to identify learning gaps and trends. By utilizing data-driven insights, the portal assists teachers, administrators, and parents in making informed decisions to support studentsâ€™ academic growth. The system was developed using modern web technologies and tested in a simulated school environment. Results demonstrate improved accessibility of performance data and enhanced collaboration between stakeholders. This study underscores the potential of performance analysis systems in driving personalized learning and improving institutional efficiency.
